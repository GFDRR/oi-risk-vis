  <h1>Southeast Asia Infrastructure Risk Prototype</h1>

  <p>This prototype tool presents infrastructure risk analytics for South-East
  Asia (SEA) using open-data sources on fluvial and coastal flooding hazard maps
  along with cyclone hazard maps. The risks are analysed and visualised for
  power plants, electricity transmission lines, road networks, railway networks,
  ports and airports in SEA. The analysis has been undertaken for the World Bank
  by Oxford Infrastructure Analytics Ltd.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the prototype is to illustrate the type and nature of
  simulation results and network data currently available in the SEA region, and
  how &ndash; using the existing toolchain &ndash; this data might be accessed
  and interrogated at a sub-national, national or super-national scale.</p>

  <p>The modelling and analysis presented here aim to support Disaster Risk
  Finance and Insurance (DRFI) decision-making by identifying spatial
  criticalities and risks under current and future hazard scenarios. It
  comprises a direct damage estimation and an indirect economic loss estimation
  of GDP disruptions due to asset failures and service disruption.</p>
